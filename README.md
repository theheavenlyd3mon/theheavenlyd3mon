# Hey, what’s up! 👋

I’m **theheavenlyd3mon**, a tech and AI enthusiast just diving into the coding scene. I’m pumped about how fast tech moves, and I’m here to tinker, build, and maybe turn this into something big someday. Right now, I’m playing around with Python (AI’s my co-pilot there) and working on a little web game I hope people will dig. Let’s see what happens!

🎮 **What I’m Working On**:  
Putting together a laid-back web game to test my chops and share some fun. It’s early days, but I’m hyped to see it come together.

🛠️ **Skills**:  
- Python (with a dash of AI help)  
- Web dev basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- Always up for picking up new tech tricks.

🌟 **Fun Facts**:  
- Anime’s my jam—love *Mobile Suit Gundam IBO*, *Bleach*, *Haikyuu*, and *Solo Leveling*.  
- Huge into martial arts manhwa too—those fight scenes hit different.  
- When I’m not coding, I’m either glued to anime or catching up on manhwa chapters.
